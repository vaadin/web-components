This is the API reference for the Vaadin Web Components. It contains information about the elements, their properties, methods, and events.

This reference is intended for developers using either the plain Web Components, or their React wrappers, with either Javascript or TypeScript.

The API documentation is generated from JSDoc annotations in the components source files. If you want to contribute to the documentation, please check corresponding packages.

For the full component documentation, including examples and guides, please refer to the [Vaadin Components documentation](https://vaadin.com/docs/latest/components).
