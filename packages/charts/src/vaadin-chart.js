/**
 * `<vaadin-chart>` is a Web Component for creating high quality charts.
 *
 * ### Basic use
 *
 * There are two ways of configuring your `<vaadin-chart>` element: **HTML API**, **JS API** and **JSON API**.
 * Note that you can make use of all APIs in your element.
 *
 * #### Configuring your chart using HTML API
 *
 * `vaadin-chart` has a set of attributes to make it easier for you to customize your chart.
 *
 * ```html
 *  <vaadin-chart title="The chart title" subtitle="The chart subtitle">
 *    <vaadin-chart-series
 *          type="column"
 *          title="The series title"
 *          values="[10,20,30]">
 *    </vaadin-chart-series>
 *  </vaadin-chart>
 * ```
 *
 * > Note that while you can set type for each series individually, for some types, such as `'bar'`, `'gauge'` and `'solidgauge'`, you
 * > have to set it as the default series type on `<vaadin-chart>` in order to work properly.
 *
 * #### Configuring your chart using JS API
 *
 * 1. Set an id for the `<vaadin-chart>` in the template
 * ```html
 *     <vaadin-chart id="mychart"></vaadin-chart>
 * ```
 * 1. Add a function that uses `configuration` property (JS Api) to set chart title, categories and data
 * ```js
 * initChartWithJSApi() {
 *     requestAnimationFrame(() => {
 *        const configuration = this.$.mychart.configuration;
 *        configuration.setTitle({ text: 'The chart title' });
 *        // By default there is one X axis, it is referenced by configuration.xAxis[0].
 *        configuration.xAxis[0].setCategories(['Jan', 'Feb', 'Mar', 'Apr', 'May', 'Jun', 'Jul', 'Aug', 'Sep', 'Oct', 'Nov', 'Dec']);
 *        configuration.addSeries({
 *            type: 'column',
 *            data: [29.9, 71.5, 106.4, 129.2, 144.0, 176.0, 135.6, 148.5, 216.4, 194.1, 95.6, 54.4]
 *        });
 *     });
 * }
 * ```
 * 1. Call that function from connectedCallback (when the element is added to a document)
 * ```js
 * connectedCallback() {
 *     super.connectedCallback();
 *     this.initChartWithJSApi();
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * #### Configuring your chart using JS JSON API
 *
 * JS JSON API is a simple alternative to the JS API.
 *
 * 1. Set an id for the `<vaadin-chart>` in the template
 * ```html
 *     <vaadin-chart id="mychart"></vaadin-chart>
 * ```
 * 1. Add a function that uses `updateConfiguration` method (JS JSON Api) to set chart title, categories and data
 * ```js
 * initChartWithJSJSONApi() {
 *     this.$.mychart.updateConfiguration({
 *       title: {
 *         text: 'The chart title'
 *       },
 *       subtitle: {
 *         text: 'Subtitle'
 *       },
 *       xAxis: {
 *         categories: ['Jan', 'Feb', 'Mar', 'Apr', 'May', 'Jun', 'Jul', 'Aug', 'Sep', 'Oct', 'Nov', 'Dec']
 *       },
 *       series: [{
 *         type: 'column',
 *         data: [29.9, 71.5, 106.4, 129.2, 144.0, 176.0, 135.6, 148.5, 216.4, 194.1, 95.6, 54.4]
 *       }]
 *     });
 * }
 * ```
 * 1. Call that function from connectedCallback (when the element is added to a document)
 * ```js
 * connectedCallback() {
 *     super.connectedCallback();
 *     this.initChartWithJSJSONApi();
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * It should be noted that chart style customization cannot be done via the JS or JSON API.
 * Styling properties in the JSON configuration will be ignored. The following section discusses chart styling.
 *
 * ### CSS Styling
 *
 * Chart appearance is primarily controlled by CSS style rules.
 * A comprehensive list of the supported style classes can be found at
 * https://www.highcharts.com/docs/chart-design-and-style/style-by-css
 *
 * See also the [Chart Styling](https://vaadin.com/docs/latest/components/charts/css-styling) documentation.
 *
 * ### RTL support
 *
 * `vaadin-charts` as well as [Highcharts](https://www.highcharts.com/) by itself are not adjusting the layout
 * based on the `dir` attribute. In order to make `vaadin-charts` display RTL content properly additional
 * JSON configuration should be used.
 * Each chart should be updated based on the specific needs, but general recommendations are:
 *
 *  1. Set `reversed` to true for xAxis (https://api.highcharts.com/highcharts/xAxis.reversed).
 *  2. Set `useHTML` to true for text elements, i.e. `tooltip` (https://api.highcharts.com/highcharts/tooltip.useHTML).
 *  3. Set `rtl` to true for `legend` (https://api.highcharts.com/highcharts/legend.rtl).
 *
 * ### Setting colors
 *
 * Although charts can be styled as described above, there is a simpler way for setting colors.
 * Colors can be set using CSS custom properties `--vaadin-charts-color-{n}` (where `n` goes from `0 - 9`).
 *
 * For example `--vaadin-charts-color-0` sets the color of the first series on a chart.
