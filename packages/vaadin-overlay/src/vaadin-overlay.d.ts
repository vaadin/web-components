/**
 * `<vaadin-overlay>` is a Web Component for creating overlays. The content of the overlay
 * can be populated in two ways: imperatively by using renderer callback function and
 * declaratively by using Polymer's Templates.
 *
 * ### Rendering
 *
 * By default, the overlay uses the content provided by using the renderer callback function.
 *
 * The renderer function provides `root`, `owner`, `model` arguments when applicable.
 * Generate DOM content by using `model` object properties if needed, append it to the `root`
 * element and control the state of the host element by accessing `owner`. Before generating new
 * content, users are able to check if there is already content in `root` for reusing it.
 *
 * ```html
 * <vaadin-overlay id="overlay"></vaadin-overlay>
 * ```
 * ```js
 * const overlay = document.querySelector('#overlay');
 * overlay.renderer = function(root) {
 *  root.textContent = "Overlay content";
 * };
 * ```
 *
 * Renderer is called on the opening of the overlay and each time the related model is updated.
 * DOM generated during the renderer call can be reused
 * in the next renderer call and will be provided with the `root` argument.
 * On first call it will be empty.
 *
 * **NOTE:** when the renderer property is defined, the `<template>` content is not used.
 *
 * ### Templating
 *
 * Alternatively, the content can be provided with Polymer Template.
 * Overlay finds the first child template and uses that in case renderer callback function
 * is not provided. You can also set a custom template using the `template` property.
 *
 * After the content from the template is stamped, the `content` property
 * points to the content container.
 *
 * The overlay provides `forwardHostProp` when calling
 * `Polymer.Templatize.templatize` for the template, so that the bindings
 * from the parent scope propagate to the content.
 *
 * ```html
 * <vaadin-overlay>
 *   <template>Overlay content</template>
 * </vaadin-overlay>
 * ```
 *
 * ### Styling
 *
 * To style the overlay content, use styles in the parent scope:
 *
 * - If the overlay is used in a component, then the component styles
 *   apply the overlay content.
 * - If the overlay is used in the global DOM scope, then global styles
 *   apply to the overlay content.
 *
 * See examples for styling the overlay content in the live demos.
 *
 * The following Shadow DOM parts are available for styling the overlay component itself:
 *
 * Part name  | Description
 * -----------|---------------------------------------------------------|
 * `backdrop` | Backdrop of the overlay
 * `overlay`  | Container for position/sizing/alignment of the content
 * `content`  | Content of the overlay
 *
 * The following state attributes are available for styling:
 *
 * Attribute | Description | Part
 * ---|---|---
 * `opening` | Applied just after the overlay is attached to the DOM. You can apply a CSS @keyframe animation for this state. | `:host`
 * `closing` | Applied just before the overlay is detached from the DOM. You can apply a CSS @keyframe animation for this state. | `:host`
 *
 * The following custom CSS properties are available for styling:
 *
 * Custom CSS property | Description | Default value
 * ---|---|---
 * `--vaadin-overlay-viewport-bottom` | Bottom offset of the visible viewport area | `0` or detected offset
 *
 * See [Styling Components](https://vaadin.com/docs/latest/ds/customization/styling-components) documentation.
 *
 * @fires {CustomEvent} opened-changed - Fired when the `opened` property changes.
 * @fires {CustomEvent} vaadin-overlay-open - Fired after the overlay is opened.
 * @fires {CustomEvent} vaadin-overlay-close - Fired before the overlay will be closed. If canceled the closing of the overlay is canceled as well.
 * @fires {CustomEvent} vaadin-overlay-closing - Fired when the overlay will be closed.
 * @fires {CustomEvent} vaadin-overlay-outside-click - Fired before the overlay will be closed on outside click. If canceled the closing of the overlay is canceled as well.
 * @fires {CustomEvent} vaadin-overlay-escape-press - Fired before the overlay will be closed on ESC button press. If canceled the closing of the overlay is canceled as well.
