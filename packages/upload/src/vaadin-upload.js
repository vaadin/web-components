/**
 * `<vaadin-upload>` is a Web Component for uploading multiple files with drag and drop support.
 *
 * Example:
 *
 * ```
 * <vaadin-upload></vaadin-upload>
 * ```
 *
 * ### Styling
 *
 * The following shadow DOM parts are available for styling:
 *
 * Part name          | Description
 * -------------------|-------------------------------------
 * `primary-buttons`  | Upload container
 * `drop-label`       | Element wrapping drop label and icon
 *
 * The following state attributes are available for styling:
 *
 * Attribute | Description | Part name
 * ---|---|---
 * `nodrop` | Set when drag and drop is disabled (e. g., on touch devices) | `:host`
 * `dragover` | A file is being dragged over the element | `:host`
 * `dragover-valid` | A dragged file is valid with `maxFiles` and `accept` criteria | `:host`
 * `max-files-reached` | The maximum number of files that the user is allowed to add to the upload has been reached | `:host`
 *
 * See [Styling Components](https://vaadin.com/docs/latest/styling/styling-components) documentation.
 *
 * @fires {CustomEvent} file-reject - Fired when a file cannot be added to the queue due to a constrain.
 * @fires {CustomEvent} files-changed - Fired when the `files` property changes.
 * @fires {CustomEvent} max-files-reached-changed - Fired when the `maxFilesReached` property changes.
 * @fires {CustomEvent} upload-before - Fired before the XHR is opened.
 * @fires {CustomEvent} upload-start - Fired when the XHR is sent.
 * @fires {CustomEvent} upload-progress - Fired as many times as the progress is updated.
