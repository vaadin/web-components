# Breadcrumbs Implementation Notes

## Task 1 — Package scaffolding and element shells

- **Commit:** 1b50b2efa8 (PR #11593)
- **Date:** pre-existing
- **Decisions:** Task 1 considered done via existing scaffolding from PR #11593 ("feat: set up initial package structure for breadcrumbs component"). Mixin chains will be completed in subsequent tasks as features are added.
- **Surprises:** —
- **Spec adjustments:** —

## Task 2 — BreadcrumbsItem — link vs non-link rendering with `path`

- **Date:** 2026-05-06
- **Decisions:** Two-branch `render()` (`if (this.path != null) ... else ...`) chosen over a unified template because the spec mandates distinct outer parts (`link` vs `nolink`). `path != null` covers both `null` and `undefined`. Property uses default `attribute: 'path'` mapping (allows `<vaadin-breadcrumbs-item path="...">`), matching side-nav-item.
- **Surprises:** —
- **Spec adjustments:** Removed the standalone "Add chevron-right icon to shared style-props" task that previously preceded this one. The icon's only consumer is the separator pseudo-element, so it was folded into the first task that uses it (now Task 11 — overflow separator). Subsequent tasks renumbered down by one.
