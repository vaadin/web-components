## Installation

Install the component:

```sh
npm i @vaadin/time-picker
```

Once installed, import the component in your application:

```js
import '@vaadin/time-picker';
```

## Themes

Vaadin components come with two built-in [themes](https://vaadin.com/docs/latest/ds/customization/using-themes), Lumo and Material.
The [main entrypoint](https://github.com/vaadin/web-components/blob/master/packages/time-picker/vaadin-time-picker.js) of the package uses the Lumo theme.

To use the Material theme, import the component from the `theme/material` folder:

```js
import '@vaadin/time-picker/theme/material/vaadin-time-picker.js';
```

You can also import the Lumo version of the component explicitly:

```js
import '@vaadin/time-picker/theme/lumo/vaadin-time-picker.js';
```

Finally, you can import the un-themed component from the `src` folder to get a minimal starting point:

```js
import '@vaadin/time-picker/src/vaadin-time-picker.js';
```
