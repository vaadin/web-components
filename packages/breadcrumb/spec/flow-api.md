# Breadcrumb Flow Developer API

<!--
Flow (Java) developer-facing API derived from requirements.md (universal + flow) and web-component-api.md. Shows the most idiomatic, minimal Java API a Flow developer would use.

NOT a specification — no connector files, no @Synchronize wiring, no method bodies, no serialisation analysis.

The Flow API ALWAYS wraps the web component. Every attribute/property/slot/event/CSS custom property in web-component-api.md is reachable from Java — see the Web API coverage check at the end.
-->

## 1. Displaying the ancestor trail as links

Covers requirement(s): 1, 2

```java
Breadcrumb breadcrumb = new Breadcrumb();
breadcrumb.add(
        new BreadcrumbItem("Home", HomeView.class),
        new BreadcrumbItem("Developer Guide", DeveloperGuideView.class),
        new BreadcrumbItem("API Reference", ApiReferenceView.class),
        new BreadcrumbItem("Authentication", AuthenticationView.class),
        new BreadcrumbItem("OAuth2")); // last item without a path is the current page
add(breadcrumb);
```

```java
// String-path overload for cases with no Flow route class
breadcrumb.add(
        new BreadcrumbItem("Home", "/"),
        new BreadcrumbItem("External", "https://example.com/docs"));
```

**Why this shape:** `Breadcrumb` is a standard Flow container — it implements `HasComponents` and accepts `BreadcrumbItem` children through the inherited `add(Component...)` / `addComponentAsFirst(...)` / `addComponentAtIndex(int, Component)` / `remove(Component...)` / `removeAll()` methods. No component-specific `setItems`/`addItem` API is invented: a breadcrumb is a component tree of items, so it uses the same primitives as any other component tree. On the web-component side the `items` JS property takes data objects, but that is a client-side concern; in Flow, items are `BreadcrumbItem` components and child management uses the Flow conventions developers already know. `BreadcrumbItem` offers the same constructor overloads as `SideNavItem`: `(label)` for the current page (no path), `(label, String path)` for hand-managed paths, `(label, Class<? extends Component> view)` as the type-safe primary form required by `DESIGN_GUIDELINES.md` "Integrate with Flow Router", and `(label, Class<? extends Component> view, RouteParameters routeParameters)` for parameterised routes. Each path-taking overload also has a prefix-component variant ending in `Component prefixComponent` (see section 4). The "current" distinction needs no extra API — an item without a path is the current item, matching the web component's declarative convention.

---

## 2. Optionally omitting the current page

Covers requirement(s): 3

```java
// All items linkable — no current-page item included in the trail
Breadcrumb breadcrumb = new Breadcrumb();
breadcrumb.add(
        new BreadcrumbItem("Home", HomeView.class),
        new BreadcrumbItem("Developer Guide", DeveloperGuideView.class),
        new BreadcrumbItem("API Reference", ApiReferenceView.class));
```

**Why this shape:** No dedicated API. When every added item has a path, no current-page indicator appears — the application simply decides whether to include a final no-path item. The Flow API inherits this from the web component's declarative convention, keeping the wrapper thin.

---

## 3. Overflow collapse and expansion

Covers requirement(s): 6, 7

```java
Breadcrumb breadcrumb = new Breadcrumb();
breadcrumb.add(
        new BreadcrumbItem("Home", HomeView.class),
        new BreadcrumbItem("Documents", DocumentsView.class),
        new BreadcrumbItem("Projects", ProjectsView.class),
        new BreadcrumbItem("2026", YearView.class, new RouteParameters("year", "2026")),
        new BreadcrumbItem("Q1", QuarterView.class, new RouteParameters("quarter", "q1")),
        new BreadcrumbItem("Reports", ReportsView.class),
        new BreadcrumbItem("Summary"));

// Localise the overflow button's accessible label
breadcrumb.setI18n(new BreadcrumbI18n().setMoreItems("Show hidden items"));
```

**Why this shape:** Overflow collapse and the expansion menu opened by the overflow indicator (req 7) are handled entirely inside the web component — the collapsed items reappear as menu rows sourced from the same `BreadcrumbItem` components the container already holds, so no Flow-side surface is needed to wire them up. The only Flow-visible concern is the overflow indicator's accessible label, localised via a nested `BreadcrumbI18n` class following the `SideNavI18n` / `MenuBarI18n` convention: `Serializable`, `@JsonInclude(JsonInclude.Include.NON_NULL)`, fluent setters. Exposed via `setI18n(BreadcrumbI18n)` / `getI18n()` on `Breadcrumb`.

---

## 4. Icons alongside item text

Covers requirement(s): 8

```java
// Inline with construction — one line per item
Breadcrumb breadcrumb = new Breadcrumb();
breadcrumb.add(
        new BreadcrumbItem("Home", HomeView.class, new Icon(VaadinIcon.HOME)),
        new BreadcrumbItem("Documents", DocumentsView.class, new Icon(VaadinIcon.FOLDER)),
        new BreadcrumbItem("Report.pdf"));
```

```java
// Or set the prefix after construction
BreadcrumbItem home = new BreadcrumbItem("Home", HomeView.class);
home.setPrefixComponent(new Icon(VaadinIcon.HOME));
```

**Why this shape:** `BreadcrumbItem` implements `HasPrefix` from `vaadin-flow-components-base`, giving every item `setPrefixComponent` / `getPrefixComponent`. In addition, each path-taking constructor has a prefix-component variant — `(label, String path, Component prefix)`, `(label, Class<? extends Component> view, Component prefix)`, `(label, Class<? extends Component> view, RouteParameters params, Component prefix)` — matching `SideNavItem` exactly so the icon-with-path case (by far the common one) reads as a single line. The web component uses `slot="prefix"` on `<vaadin-breadcrumb-item>` and mirroring that through `HasPrefix` reuses the surface Flow developers already know. web-component-api.md explicitly does not support icons via the programmatic `items` property; Flow sidesteps that limitation because its programmatic API is component-based (`add(BreadcrumbItem...)`), not a data-object array, so icons work the same way whether the prefix is passed through a constructor or assigned via `setPrefixComponent` after construction.

---

## 5. Dynamic trail updates

Covers requirement(s): 9

```java
// Imperative form — rebuild the trail when the browsed category changes
Breadcrumb breadcrumb = new Breadcrumb();
breadcrumb.add(
        new BreadcrumbItem("Home", HomeView.class),
        new BreadcrumbItem("Electronics", CategoryView.class, new RouteParameters("slug", "electronics")),
        new BreadcrumbItem("Laptops", CategoryView.class, new RouteParameters("slug", "laptops")),
        new BreadcrumbItem("Gaming"));

categorySelector.addValueChangeListener(event -> {
    Category category = event.getValue();
    breadcrumb.removeAll();
    breadcrumb.add(
            new BreadcrumbItem("Home", HomeView.class),
            new BreadcrumbItem(category.getName(), CategoryView.class,
                    new RouteParameters("slug", category.getSlug())),
            new BreadcrumbItem(category.getChild().getName()));
});
```

```java
// Reactive form — run an effect that rebuilds the children when a signal changes
ValueSignal<Category> current = new ValueSignal<>(initialCategory);

Breadcrumb breadcrumb = new Breadcrumb();
Signal.effect(breadcrumb, () -> {
    Category category = current.get();
    breadcrumb.removeAll();
    breadcrumb.add(
            new BreadcrumbItem("Home", HomeView.class),
            new BreadcrumbItem(category.getName(), CategoryView.class,
                    new RouteParameters("slug", category.getSlug())),
            new BreadcrumbItem(category.getChild().getName()));
});

// Any code that updates the signal flows through to the breadcrumb
current.set(nextCategory);
```

**Why this shape:** Imperative updates use the standard component-tree primitives `add(...)`, `remove(...)`, `removeAll()` inherited from `HasComponents` — the same API a Flow developer uses for any container. Reactive updates use `Signal.effect(component, Runnable)`, Flow core's primitive for running a callback whenever the observed signals change; the effect is the right granularity here because the trail is rebuilt as a tree operation (`removeAll` + `add`), not a single property set. This avoids inventing a component-specific `bindItems` surface when the generic effect primitive already covers the case. The web component's `items` JS property (see web-component-api.md §6) is never exposed directly from Java — it represents a data array on the client, while the Flow wrapper always manages a tree of `BreadcrumbItem` components.

---

## 6. Navigation landmark

Covers requirement(s): 10

```java
Breadcrumb breadcrumb = new Breadcrumb();
breadcrumb.setAriaLabel("Product navigation");
breadcrumb.add(
        new BreadcrumbItem("Home", HomeView.class),
        new BreadcrumbItem("Products", ProductsView.class),
        new BreadcrumbItem("Laptops"));
```

**Why this shape:** `Breadcrumb` implements `HasAriaLabel` from Flow core — the standard Vaadin way to expose an accessible name. The web component already renders itself as a `<nav>` landmark automatically (see web-component-api.md §7), so the only Flow-facing API is the label. No component-specific default label is provided (confirmed in requirements.md Discussion).

---

## 7. Current page announced as current

Covers requirement(s): 11

```java
// No Flow API needed — the last item without a path is automatically
// the current page, and the web component applies aria-current="page" to it.
breadcrumb.add(
        new BreadcrumbItem("Home", HomeView.class),
        new BreadcrumbItem("Docs", DocsView.class),
        new BreadcrumbItem("OAuth2")); // aria-current="page" applied automatically
```

**Why this shape:** Requirement 11 is satisfied entirely by the web component's built-in behaviour (see web-component-api.md §8): the last no-path item receives `aria-current="page"` without developer action. Introducing a Flow-side `setCurrent(...)` API would duplicate the "no path means current" convention established in requirement 1 and the web component API, violating the no-bloat principle.

---

## 8. Default trail derived from the router hierarchy

Covers requirement(s): 13

```java
@Route("")
@PageTitle("Home")
public class HomeView extends Div { ... }

@Route("customers")
@PageTitle("Customers")
public class CustomersView extends Div { ... }

@Route("customers/archive")
@PageTitle("Archive")
public class ArchiveView extends Div {
    public ArchiveView() {
        // Zero configuration: empty breadcrumb auto-populates from the router.
        add(new Breadcrumb());
        // Renders as: Home › Customers › Archive
    }
}
```

**Why this shape:** A `Breadcrumb` that has no children at attach time auto-populates itself from static route metadata. `@PageTitle` supplies each item's label and `@RouteParent` (or URL-prefix walking, see section 10) supplies the hierarchy — so auto-population never instantiates ancestor views. For the current (instantiated) view, `HasDynamicTitle` is honoured so a dynamic self-label works without further configuration. Data-dependent ancestor labels (e.g. "Acme Corp" for a specific customer) are out of scope for auto-population — applications that need them construct the trail themselves via `add(...)` (section 9). This is a Flow-only behaviour; the web component itself remains router-agnostic.

---

## 9. Opting out of automatic trail population

Covers requirement(s): 14

```java
// The common case: just add the items. Auto-population is skipped.
Breadcrumb breadcrumb = new Breadcrumb();
breadcrumb.add(
        new BreadcrumbItem("Catalog", CatalogView.class),
        new BreadcrumbItem(category.getName()));
```

```java
// Async loading — add a placeholder so the breadcrumb has a child at
// attach time and the router-derived default does not flash in.
Breadcrumb breadcrumb = new Breadcrumb();
BreadcrumbItem placeholder = new BreadcrumbItem("");
breadcrumb.add(placeholder);
loadCategoryAsync(category -> {
    breadcrumb.removeAll();
    breadcrumb.add(buildTrail(category));
});
```

**Why this shape:** Opting out is a consequence of being a parent, not a separate toggle. If the `Breadcrumb` has any child at attach time, auto-population is skipped — the application has declared ownership by populating the tree. For the asynchronous-loading scenario, adding a single empty placeholder before attach claims ownership deterministically; the placeholder is replaced (`removeAll` + `add`) when data arrives. No public `setAutoPopulate` / `isAutoPopulate` surface is needed — the state is a consequence of the component tree, kept internal to the breadcrumb. This keeps the API surface for requirement 14 tiny and removes precedence questions between a flag and the children list.

---

## 10. Route-parent annotation overrides URL-based parent lookup

Covers requirement(s): 15

```java
@Route("orders/edit/:orderId")
@RouteParent(OrdersView.class)
@PageTitle("Edit Order")
public class EditOrderView extends Div { ... }
```

```java
// Renders as: Home › Orders › Edit Order
// (instead of Home › Orders › Edit › Edit Order implied by the URL segments)
```

**Why this shape:** A class-level annotation `@RouteParent(Class<? extends Component>)` declares a view's parent in the application's route hierarchy, overriding URL-prefix walking. It is deliberately named in route-hierarchy terms rather than breadcrumb-specific terms — the relationship it expresses ("this route's conceptual parent is that route") is independent of breadcrumb rendering and can be consumed by any navigation component that needs to traverse the hierarchy. An annotation (vs a method on a new interface) is the right shape for this because the information is static and known at compile time — mirroring how `@Route`, `@RouteAlias`, and `@PageTitle` are themselves annotations. Walking continues from the declared parent using the same rules, so chains of `@RouteParent` compose naturally. The annotation lives alongside the other Flow route metadata on the view class.

## Discussion

**Q: Why add prefix-component overloads to the `BreadcrumbItem` constructors?**

Icons are the primary real-world use of the prefix slot (home icon on the root, folder icon on category items), and calling `setPrefixComponent(...)` on a separate line after construction is noticeably more verbose than the idiomatic Flow form for other components. `SideNavItem` — the closest convention anchor — already exposes the same prefix-component overloads, so Breadcrumb matching them keeps the two components consistent and lets the most common declaration (icon + label + route) fit on one line. `setPrefixComponent` remains available for the case where the prefix is determined after construction (e.g. dynamic icon based on data), so the convenience overloads do not reduce flexibility.

**Q: Why no public `setAutoPopulate` / `isAutoPopulate`?**

Keeping the flag internal means there's only one way to express "the application is managing this trail": add a child to the `Breadcrumb`. A separate public boolean introduces precedence questions ("does the flag override the children, or vice versa?") and a footgun class ("I added items but forgot to flip the flag, and the next re-attach surprised me"). Collapsing the concern into the child tree makes intent unambiguous: having any child — real item or placeholder — means the application owns the trail for that instance, and the router-derived default is not re-applied. The asynchronous-loading case that earlier designs used `setAutoPopulate(false)` for is now expressed by adding a placeholder item (section 9). Keeping the API surface for requirement 14 tiny is worth more than retaining a direct boolean accessor.

**Q: How is requirement 16 (data-driven trails that depend on runtime data) covered without a dedicated API?**

It is covered by manual construction: the application loads the data it needs in the view and calls `add(...)` / `removeAll()` (section 5 and section 9) to build the trail. Every dynamic case — the customer-name example, per-user conditional items, trails derived from domain state — can be expressed this way using the standard component-tree APIs. For reactive updates, `Signal.effect(breadcrumb, ...)` rebuilds the children whenever observed signals change. A dedicated declarative mechanism (for example a `BreadcrumbProvider` that receives a `BreadcrumbContext` describing the current navigation, and returns the full trail so that the breadcrumb recomputes itself on each route change) was designed out through several iterations and ultimately excluded from this first version. The reasons: the manual-construction path already works end-to-end; a good provider API carries non-trivial surface (a context type, lookup helpers for static metadata, rules for when the provider runs, per-instance vs. application-wide scope) that is hard to get right without real application feedback; and once introduced the provider shape is hard to evolve. A provider API remains a likely future addition once usage patterns are known — this version intentionally keeps the surface small.

**Q: Why is there no section for the separator (reqs 4, 5, 12)?**

Separator presence (req 4), customisation (req 5), and RTL flipping (req 12) are all handled entirely by the web component and the theme — there is no Flow-specific Java API to demonstrate. Per `DESIGN_GUIDELINES.md` "Styling lives in CSS, not Java", visual customisations like the separator icon are exposed as CSS custom properties on the host, not as Java setters: applications use `HasStyle#getStyle().set("--vaadin-breadcrumb-separator", ...)` or a theme stylesheet. A dedicated "here's how to call `getStyle()`" section would duplicate generic Flow knowledge without adding Breadcrumb-specific value, so these requirements are documented solely in the Web API coverage table (the `--vaadin-breadcrumb-separator` row and the RTL row).

**Q: Why no click listener on `BreadcrumbItem`?**

Items render as plain anchors (`<a href>`) under the hood. With `setPath(Class<? extends Component>)`, Flow's router intercepts the click and navigates without full page reload. With `setPath(String)`, the browser follows the href. Neither path requires a Flow-level listener, and adding one would invite developers to implement navigation twice (once as a listener, once as a route). `SideNavItem` follows the same philosophy — no `addClickListener`.

**Q: Why no theme variants?**

web-component-api.md does not expose any theme variants for Breadcrumb — the component has a single canonical appearance with theme-layer differences only (Lumo vs Aura). No `BreadcrumbVariant` enum is added because there is nothing for it to contain. One can be introduced later if variants emerge.

**Q: Why use `HasComponents#add(Component...)` rather than a typed `setItems(BreadcrumbItem...)` / `addItem(BreadcrumbItem...)` API?**

A breadcrumb is a container of items — in Flow terms, a component that holds child components. Expressing that through the standard `HasComponents` interface (the same one used by `Div`, `VerticalLayout`, `Dialog`'s content, etc.) keeps the API consistent with every other Flow container, gives developers `add`, `addComponentAsFirst`, `addComponentAtIndex`, `remove`, and `removeAll` for free, and avoids inventing yet another bespoke item-collection surface. The cost — `add` accepts any `Component` rather than only `BreadcrumbItem` — is handled at runtime: non-`BreadcrumbItem` children are rejected by the breadcrumb (implementation detail, not part of this design). On the web-component side the `items` JS property takes data objects, but that is a client-side rendering concern; in Flow, a trail is a component tree.

**Q: Why no dedicated `bindItems(Signal<...>)` method?**

Flow core's `Signal.effect(component, Runnable)` already provides the primitive for reactive child-tree updates: the effect re-runs whenever observed signals change, and inside it the application calls `removeAll()` + `add(...)` to rebuild the trail. A component-specific `bindItems` would wrap that primitive in a convenience, but at the cost of an extra API surface, a `SignalBinding<List<BreadcrumbItem>>` return type, its own `BindingActiveException` lifecycle, and questions about how it composes with direct `add` calls. Keeping the reactive story on `Signal.effect` reuses an API developers already know and leaves the door open to introduce a sugar method later if real usage shows it is worth the surface.

**Q: What happens if `@RouteParent` forms a cycle or points at a class without `@Route`?**

These are implementation concerns the spec (`create-component-flow-spec`) will resolve — the expected behaviour is that cycles are detected and truncated, and a parent class without `@Route` is treated as if the annotation were absent (fall back to URL-prefix walking). The API surface here is only the annotation itself; the resolution algorithm belongs to the specification.

**Q: Why `@RouteParent` rather than a breadcrumb-specific name?**

The annotation expresses a route-hierarchy relationship — "the conceptual parent of this route is that route" — which is not inherently tied to breadcrumb rendering. Naming it `@RouteParent` (vs. `@BreadcrumbParent` or `@BreadcrumbRouteParent`) keeps the declaration reusable: any future navigation component that needs to walk the route hierarchy (e.g. a back-navigation helper, an SEO link-graph generator, a parent-link utility) can consume the same annotation without the name implying it belongs to Breadcrumb alone. The `@Route*` prefix also groups it naturally with the existing routing annotations (`@Route`, `@RouteAlias`) in Flow core, so developers find it where they look for route metadata. This avoids coupling application-level hierarchy metadata to a specific presentation component — the view author declares a routing fact, not a breadcrumb hint.

**Q: Why is `BreadcrumbI18n` a class rather than a single setter for `moreItems`?**

Only one translatable string exists today, but the nested-class shape follows `SideNavI18n` and `MenuBarI18n` so that future accessibility strings (for example an announcement when the trail updates, or per-item aria-label fallback text) can be added without a breaking API change. Keeping the JSON-backed i18n object convention consistent across Vaadin Flow components also lets Vaadin's i18n tooling treat them uniformly.
