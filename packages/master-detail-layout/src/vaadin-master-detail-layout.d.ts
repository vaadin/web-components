 * `<vaadin-master-detail-layout>` is a web component for building UIs with a master

 * overlaid on top of, the master area, depending on configuration and viewport size.
 *

 *
 * The following shadow DOM parts are available for styling:
 *
 * Part name      | Description
 * ---------------|----------------------
 * `backdrop`     | Backdrop covering the master area in the drawer mode
 * `master`       | The master area
 * `detail`       | The detail area
 *
 * The following state attributes are available for styling:
 *
 * Attribute      | Description
 * ---------------| -----------
 * `containment`  | Set to `layout` or `viewport` depending on the containment.
 * `orientation`  | Set to `horizontal` or `vertical` depending on the orientation.
 * `has-detail`   | Set when the detail content is provided.
 * `drawer`       | Set when the layout is using the drawer mode.
