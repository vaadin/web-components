/**
 * A Lit directive for populating the content of the dialog.
 *
 * The directive accepts a renderer callback returning a Lit template and assigns it to the dialog
 * via the `renderer` property. The renderer is called to populate the content once when assigned
 * and whenever a single dependency or an array of dependencies changes.
 * It is not guaranteed that the renderer will be called immediately (synchronously) in both cases.
 *
 * Dependencies can be a single value or an array of values.
 * Values are checked against previous values with strict equality (`===`),
 * so the check won't detect nested property changes inside objects or arrays.
 * When dependencies are provided as an array, each item is checked against the previous value
 * at the same index with strict equality. Nested arrays are also checked only by strict
 * equality.
 *
 * Example of usage:
 * ```js
 * `<vaadin-dialog
 *   ${dialogRenderer((dialog) => html`...`)}
 * ></vaadin-dialog>`
 * ```
 *
 * @param renderer the renderer callback that returns a Lit template.
 * @param dependencies a single dependency or an array of dependencies
 *                     which trigger a re-render when changed.
